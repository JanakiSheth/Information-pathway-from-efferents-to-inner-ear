# Information-pathway-from-efferents-to-inner-ear
One of my recent research projects is on auditory neuroscience, specifically how stimulation of the efferent neuronal pathway affects the mechanical response of the inner ear. Our lab works with the bullfrog, however the literature on the whole pathway of hair bundle - hair cell - efferents is not consistent. This has taken a lot of sifting through papers and I am putting together a code here in the aim that it will aid others interested in studying the feedback control of the efferents.
